<p>We imagine a university of possibilities. "Labor in Context" is a free student-organized event on March 15 and 16, open to all, involving a full-day workshop and a series of drop-in trainings. Rather than presenting papers, we will be sharing strategies for bettering our universities and communities founded in reflection on labor in the university. The workshop is organized by graduate students from the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society at Columbia University.

<h1>SCHEDULE</h1>
<h3>Friday (3/15) Full-day Intensive<br><a href="#directions">Heyman Center for the Humanities</a></h3>

<p><em>10:00AM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Coffee and Breakfast</span>
</p>

<p>
<em>10:30AM	</strong></em><br>	
<span class="red">Thinking Backwards: How to Assume We Have Everything <br>(and the institution has nothing)</span><br>
Natalia Nakazawa<br><br>
In this workshop, participants will examine the concept of “having.” Who has what? How does “having” or “not having” impact the way we move, act, think, and feel? How can we shapeshift this paradigm into a position of generosity, as opposed to scarcity? What if it meant asking better questions? We will look at 4 different types of models of knowledge creation and collaboratively come up with answers through the production of a zine.<br><br>

<span class="red">Action Across Oceans: How to Build and Sustain a Movement While Abroad</span><br>
Xiaowen Liang and Winnie Shen, Chinese Feminist Collective<br><br>
Strategies and tactics that CFC has utilized to a great deal of success involve hosting talks at universities, feminist training camps, performance art, and informal “story telling” dinners. These various actions serve to not only increase international awareness but also radicalize Chinese students before they return to an oppressive state. This workshop will focus on how to mobilize non-traditional activist methods, including street and performance art, to build consciousness and develop a constituency in multiple locales. 
</p>

<p>
<em>11:45PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Surviving Precarious Labor <br></span>
Lucy Hunter and Clynton Lowry, Art Handler<br><br>
This workshop will address preparedness and survival in the face of precarious labor conditions: adjunct teaching, the gig economy, government shutdowns, et al. Taking a page from doomsday preppers, the online community of readiness aficionados, workshop participants will have a chance to design a survival kit tailored to the needs of the modern 1099 contractor. <br><br>

<span class="red">Extra Credit</span><br>
Natasha Bunten<br>
Why does most writing in the humanities get credited to just one person? Why are most artworks attributed to one artist? This workshop will aim to map out the kinds of collaboration, credited and uncredited, compensated and uncompensated, that underpin all academic and artistic labor. Participants will walk away from this interactive activity with a model for an exhaustive "credit roll"---perhaps like those used in the movie industry---that they can apply to their own work, and an awareness of both the significance and limitations of giving credit where it's due in our work.
</p>

<p>
<em>1:00PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Lunch</span><br><br>

<em>2:00PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Governance and the University</span><br>
A conversation with Rebecca E Karl
</p>

<p>
<em>2:30PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Hacking Old Age through Broken Machines</span><br>
Katryn Evinson<br><br>
In a project I am currently developing as part of the Public Humanities fellowship, I am working with elder communities constructing alternative narratives about technology and decrepitude in order to open up new ways of thinking about technology that are detached from instrumentality and productivity. The project culminates with a series of workshops where participants experiment with obsolete and broken technology to develop their own creative works whereby they aim to engage other meanings of technology concerning repair, recycling, and non-instrumentality. In this paper, I will share the findings obtained so far from the workshops while providing a theoretical analysis of the paradoxes risen as a result of the encounter of the aged and technology.<br><br>

<span class="red">Department Mapping and Organizing</span><br>
Sonam Singh<br><br>
Bringing his experience organizing with other adjuncts at Barnard College, Singh will lead a workshop on power mapping and member networking at the university and in your department. These skills are aimed at strengthening union power at Columbia after union recognition and look to current and future labor struggles at the university.  
</p>

<p>
<em>3:45PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Ad-hocification and Adjuncts in the Indian University</span><br>
Sanchita Khurana<br><br>
Join Khurana for discussion about labor conditions and subjectivity for adjuncts at her home university, faculty solidarity, and transnational university comparison.<br><br>

<span class="red">Sick and Tired: Illness, Disability, and University Labor<br></span>
Liz Bowen<br><br>
Health care tends to be a major talking point for university labor movements, and for good reason. Contingent workers are often stuck with high premiums and deductibles and shoddy health services, with limited hours and overbooked medical professionals—if they are offered health coverage at all. Meanwhile, university offices of disability services, most of whose users are undergraduates, don't always seem relevant to other university community members' particular needs. This workshop will focus on how the specific conditions in which we are able, or unable, to care for our bodyminds affect our working and learning conditions. In other words, how do the experiences of illness, disability, and negotiating inadequate health care systems affect our relationships to study? As a group of variously abled and disabled workers and learners, we will think together about what it might it look like to cultivate systems of care, access, and accommodation that nurture, rather than strain, those relationships.
</p>

<p>
<em>5:00PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Network to Support Net Worth</span><br>
Janelle Naomi Rouse<br><br>
In this class, we will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of receiving a higher education in America, thinking about what we value and why. It is often said that one's network is their net worth, however, in this consumerism, capitalistic country that we live in, it is important to re-evaluate what we associate with a person's net worth. Viewing a net worth from a more holistic perspective, we know that it is important to have money in this country because it is vital to our survival and quality of life. Moving through this workshop, we will develop through interactive activities a critical system to analyze the value that a degree and more money places on our lives and compare that to the same value that connections and a powerful network place on our lives. We will peruse ways to expand and deepen our connections by developing a network that is powerful in its potential and integral to our lives thriving. <br><br>

<span class="red">Decolonizing Curricula<br></span>
Sydnee Corriders, Ama Konadu, and Elise Jayakar<br><br>

During their time at Columbia School of Social Work (CSSW), Sydnee Corriders, LMSW, Ama Konadu, LMSW, and Elise Jayakar, MSW were student organizers in the movement for racial and social justice. Their work together began in the development of a Power, Racism, Oppression, and Privilege (PROP) course, which was introduced into the required curriculum of the school by student demands. Following the development of the course, there was resistance to implement the agreed-upon demand, and student organizers were forced to advocate for its implementation. Now the course is entitled, Foundations: Decolonizing Social Work and is mandatory for all first-year students, with Fall of 2018 being the first iteration of the material. As alumni, Sydnee, Ama, and Elise all work as Racial Equity Consultants. Since the initial rollout of the course, they have consulted for CSSW to support in the continued growth and success of the class. 
</p>

<p>
<em>6:30PM</strong></em><br>
<span class="red">Dinner</span><br><br>
          
<span class="red">Whisper Networks</span><br>
          SCA Pizza Party<br><br>
SCA Pizza Party will be guiding a dinnertime whisper network activity. Giving a short introduction to the Pizza Party group, which formed in the wake of sexual harassment scandals at NYU, we will try out their techniques for improving whisper networks and graduate worker solidarity in ways that circumvent the university’s existing, flawed grievance procedures – while enjoying delicious pizza (gluten-free and vegan options available!). <br><br>

<em>followed by</em><br><br>
<span class="red">The Art of Marketing<br></span>
Satpreet Kahlon<br><br>
Tentative description: in this zine-making workshop, participants will deconstruct marketing materials from their home institutions with an attention to what is occluded in these materials in the drive for recruitment and fundraising. In the end, we will make brochures about our institutions “as they really are,” failings, aspirations, and all.
